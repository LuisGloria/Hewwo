I managed to snoop around, I found 2 databases

users.db
staff.db

It appears to have a lot of entries, but most have been redacted for god knows why...

I've also found a new domain in Zilo's website, just add "private-" at the start, I wonder
why did he create a separate domain...the website looks almost the same...

I feel like I'm being observed even if I'm a computer program, Zilo's paranoia both makes and doesn't make sense...
I'm concerned for him, I know you're- or well, all of you, are smart, you're reading this after all.
